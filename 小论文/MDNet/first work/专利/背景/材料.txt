基于深度学习的结肠息肉检测方法[18-21]
目前息肉的检测工作多为结肠息肉的检测[26,27]
为了解决上述问题，本文提出了特征融合提取模块，并将该模块与YOLOv3网络相结合[38]。在传统的



1.只用弱标注的重要性The ability of learning from weak annotations is very important for two reasons: first, image understanding aims at learning an growing body of complex visual concepts (e.g. hundred thousands object categories in ImageNet). Second, CNN training is data-hungry. Therefore,being able to learn complex concepts using only light supervision can reduce significantly the cost of data annotation in tasks such as image segmentation, image captioning, or object detection
2.选用cnn来做特征提取层的原因We are motivated in our research by the hypothesis that,since pre-trained CNNs generalise so well to a large number of tasks, they should contain meaningful representations of the data. For example, there exists evidence that CNNs trained for image classification learn proxies to ob�jects and objects parts. Remarkably, these concepts are acquired implicitly, without ever providing the network
with information about the location of such structures in images. Hence, CNNs trained for image classification may already contain implicitly most of the information required to perform object detection.
3.WSDDN速度不错:Since the system can be trained end-to-end using standard CNN packages, it is also
as efficient as the recent fully-supervised Fast R-CNN detector of Girshick
